## About gameplay
The main objective of the game is to survive as much as possible. The player dies when the hp (marked with hearts) is 0/3 or when the energy (marked with light bulbs) is 0/5. The energy is deacreasing by 1 every 10 seconds.

When a meteogift (the gift in flames) hits you, you loose 1 hp. The meteogifts are spowned randomly around the player and their velocity is set by the game difficulty (marked with gingerbread man).

The difficulty (marked with gingerbread man) is increasing by 1 every 10 seconds.

The above statuses can be affected by collecting different items spowned randomly on the map.

|Status name|Icon|Description|
|----|-----|-------|
|Energy|Light bulb|Adds 1 energy when is collected|
|HP|Heart|Adds 1 HP when is collected|
|Difficulty|Gingerbread man|Decreases 1 difficulty lvl when is collected|
